		<h1>Hello World.</h1>
		<p>Arianna is really cool! She's an artist in her second year of the AGPM major, with the goal of being a graphic designer. An art project she's working on is designing her first tattoo! In the past, she interned at Pixar animation! That's awesome!</p>
		<p>I'm Max, a third year AGPM major working my way to understand programming. I've been developing my art career on the side, where I've grown a decent income (for a college student). My end goal is being able to write and draw my own comics!</p>
