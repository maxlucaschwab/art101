	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p>When doing Lab 5 we did not face any challenges.The assignment was straight forward and easy to complete.</p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p>We didn't have any problems when we got to atom, but in the browser console things worked slightly differently than expected. It worked out, but Max was used to Python commands.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>As you can see, the index.html file functions and the Javascript file was successfully completed and linked.</p>
