		<h1>Lab 3: File Structures</h1>
		<p> The goal of this lab was to create an ordered file structre linking the first six labs, practicing lists and linking, and organizing information on each page.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>There aren't a lot of challenging aspects to this lab so far, but one thing I'm having trouble with is creativity. Writing the HTML isn't giving me nearly as much trouble as formatting and customization is, especially since I don't know a lot of the common conventions.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>As you can see, I was able to create the file structure with a working index.html for lab 3. Proof of such is demonstrated below.</p>
