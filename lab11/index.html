    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <p id = "challenges">Our main challenges were not knowing enough about JQuery to make the process go by more efficiently. We didn't know how to be efficient with our code, and ended up making individual buttons for each paragraph even though we probably could have made a single instance.</p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p id = "problems">Other problems we encountered was the steep learning curve associated with CSS. We were struggling to come up with fun ideas to use for our css, so we need to do research into what exactly is possible.</p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p id = "results">Press the buttons and find out for yourself what the results are! We're pretty pleased with the outcome.</p>
