	<h1>Challenges</h1>
	<p>We didn't have any major challenges when working on this lab.</p>
	<h1>Problems</h1>
	<p>We did run into a few problems, namely the .sort() function. We initially wrote .sort('') and couldn't find what went wrong. Additionally, we had trouble distributing the space " " in the sorted name.</p>
	<h1>Results</h1>
	<p>As you can see, everything works :)</p>
