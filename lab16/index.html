    <div id = "challenges">
      <p>When working on lab 16 it was more challenging than we expected. We ran into a few problems in the beginning when working on the lab such as we forgot that when working with API in google chrome we need to install the “CORS Unblock” extension and we got stuck on it for a couple of minutes until someone in the discord brought it up.</p>

    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <div id = "problems">
      <p>We installed the extension and the error we had when working on it was gone. We also had a problem with the image not loading in.</p>
