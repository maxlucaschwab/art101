    <h1>Challenges</h1>
    <p id="Challenges"> The main challenges we faced in this lab was getting the function we made for lab 7 to work properly. Oddly enough, the split function wouldn't work because the input was undefined. To fix this, we changed he function we made slightly so it automatically converted the input to a string.</p>
    <h1>Problems</h1>
    <p id="Problems"> Other than the above challenges, we didn't really have any problems.</p>
